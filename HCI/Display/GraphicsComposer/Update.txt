GraphicsComposer software updates

V2.1.3.0
- Recombined 4DGL ans Serial operation into one version
- Increased maximum Sector Offset for uSD Raw load format from 2GB to allow for 32GB cards

V2.1.2.0
- Windows 7 CPU type fix
- Reloading "Movie" fix. Application would sometimes freeze when you clicked on and off a movie in the
  Actions window several times.
- Registry "null" value fix when the software is first setup (possibly only on Windows 7)

V2.1.1.0
- Divided application into 2 parts, Graphics Composer 4DGL and Graphics Composer Serial.

V2.1.0.3
- Fixed problem where if the size of the display was changed (Resolution on Properties Page) to
  a smaller value and then an image was selected that was larger than this value, GC would have an
  exception.
- KNOWN ISSUE - some (possibly inbuilt) SD card readers may not work when writing the data to the card.
  Try another external (USB) card reader.

V2.1.0.2
- Fixed text description problem for images and movies in "Serial Command Platform" to reflect the
  adjusted image/movie size according the "Size Mode" instead of the selected size. The now means
  the "Data" section in each image/movie now reflects the actual command data detailed at the
  bottom of the file.
- Some card partitioning would not allow correct writing of data to uSD cards. This fix requires
  that the application "Run As Administrator" on Vista. This is handled with the inserted manifest
  if you run the actual application. If you create a shortcut you need to adjust the properties and
  tick "Run As Administrator" (right click shortcut -> Properties -> Shortcut -> Advanced)

V2.1.0.1
- Fixed problem on Vista where "FAT" formatted cards could not be used for "Raw" format loading.
- In "RAW" format the images were being loaded at a higher sector location than reported in the GC file.

- Known issue: Loading an animated GIF into an "Image" will cause the application to crash.
