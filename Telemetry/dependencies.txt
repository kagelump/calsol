Dependencies and where to find them
-----------------------------------
Python_
    All of the code is written in Python, so you need to get this first.
    
    Use version 2.5 or higher, but not the 3.x series (Python 3.0 is not
    backwards compatible with extension libraries that we want to use)
    
Setuptools_
    This is a packaging library used by some of the libraries that we need
    and it's not possible to install them without setuptools
    
    Also, installing setuptools allows you to use easy_install on several of
    the other dependencies, which is convenient.

NumPy and SciPy_
    These NumPy/SciPy + matplotlib form the core of the graph plotting.

    Do not install Numeric or Numarray - these are outdated forks of NumPy

Matplotlib_
    Generates pretty graphs

PySerial_
    Handles communication over serial ports.

PythonXbee_
    Handles reading XBee API frames asynchronously using PySerial.

PySQLite_
    This is included with Python 2.5+ in the standard library as sqlite3

PySide_
    Python bindings to the QT4 GUI library.

Xbee Firmware
--------------------
X-CTU may not include newer versions of the firmware. The Xbee-Pros that we have use the 10E6 firmware, which is included in the repository. To install it, go to the "Modem Configuration" tab and select "Download new versions..."

Click on File to install any manually downloaded zip files (like the 10E6 firmware in the repository), and install it.

Libraries for the BRAIN
--------------------
Ryan's BrainCan Library
Xbee-Arduino library (patched version that allows you to select which UART to use is in the repository)
